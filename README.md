# CentOS Automotive Suite Operator

An operator for building automotive OS images on OpenShift. This operator provides a cloud-native way to create automotive OS images using the automotive-image-builder (AIB) project, with support for both traditional AIB manifests and modern bootc container builds.

## Description

The CentOS Automotive Suite Operator enables automotive OS image building through:

- **ImageBuild Custom Resource**: Declaratively define and trigger automotive OS image builds
- **Multiple Build Modes**: Support for traditional AIB manifests and bootc container builds
- **CLI Tool (caib)**: Command-line interface for creating and monitoring builds
- **Artifact Management**: Serve built images via OpenShift Routes or push to OCI registries
- **Tekton Integration**: Uses OpenShift Pipelines (Tekton) for scalable build execution

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**For OpenShift Installation (Recommended):**
- OpenShift 4.18+ cluster
- OpenShift Pipelines Operator (Tekton) installed
- Cluster admin permissions (for initial installation)

**For Development:**
- Go 1.22.0+
- Podman or Docker
- OpenShift CLI (`oc`) or kubectl
- Operator SDK v1.42.0+ (for development)

## Installation

### Option 1: OpenShift OperatorHub (Recommended)

The easiest way to install on OpenShift is through OperatorHub:

1. Open the OpenShift Console
2. Navigate to **Operators** > **OperatorHub**
3. Search for "CentOS Automotive Suite"
4. Click **Install** and follow the prompts

After installation, create an `OperatorConfig` to enable components:

```sh
oc apply -f config/samples/automotive_v1_operatorconfig.yaml
```

### Option 2: OLM Catalog (Local Testing)

For local development and testing with a custom-built operator:

```sh
# Build, push, and install the operator via OLM catalog and keep the existing config
./hack/deploy-catalog.sh -y --keep-config

# Create OperatorConfig to configure the operator
oc apply -f config/samples/automotive_v1_operatorconfig.yaml
```

### Installing the CLI (caib)

The `caib` CLI lets you create, monitor, and download builds from the command line.

**Install the latest release:**

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/centos-automotive-suite/automotive-dev-operator/main/hack/install-caib.sh | bash
```

Or install a specific version:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/centos-automotive-suite/automotive-dev-operator/main/hack/install-caib.sh | bash -s -- v0.1.0
```

**Configure the API endpoint:**

```sh
export CAIB_SERVER=https://build-api-automotive-dev-operator.apps.<cluster-domain>
```

The CLI auto-detects authentication from your `oc login` session. You can also set `CAIB_TOKEN` explicitly.


For usage, build examples, Jumpstarter flashing, and the full command reference, see [`cmd/caib/README.md`](cmd/caib/README.md).

## Uninstallation

### For OperatorHub Installation

1. In OpenShift Console, go to **Operators** > **Installed Operators**
2. Find "CentOS Automotive Suite" and click the options menu
3. Select **Uninstall Operator**

### For OLM Catalog Installation

```sh
./hack/deploy-catalog.sh uninstall -y
```

## Components

### CLI Tool

The `caib` CLI provides command-line access to build operations. Key command groups:

- **`caib image`** — build, flash, list, show, download, delete, and manage OS images
- **`caib workspace`** — create developer workspaces with cross-compilation toolchains, sync code, and deploy to boards
- **`caib container`** — build container images on-cluster using Shipwright
- **`caib catalog`** — publish and manage an image catalog for discovery and deployment

See [Installing the CLI](#installing-the-cli-caib) for setup and [`cmd/caib/README.md`](cmd/caib/README.md) for the full command reference.

## Architecture

### Dependencies

- **OpenShift Pipelines Operator**: Required for Tekton pipeline execution
- **OpenShift 4.18+**: Minimum supported OpenShift version
- **Container Registry**: For storing built images (--internal-registry)

## Development

### Local Development

1. **Clone and setup:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/centos-automotive-suite/automotive-dev-operator.git
cd automotive-dev-operator
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```sh
# Unit tests
make test

# Linting
make lint

# Formatting
make fmt
```

### Building

```sh
# Build all binaries
make build

# Build specific components
make build-caib           # CLI tool

# Build container images
make docker-build
```

## CI

### GitHub Actions

Builds, tests, and publishes releases via `.github/workflows/`. On `v*` tags, GHA builds multi-arch operator and toolchain images, OLM bundle/catalog, `caib` CLI binaries, and creates a GitHub Release.

### Konflux CI (self-hosted)

Operator, bundle, and catalog images can be built on a self-hosted [Konflux](https://konflux-ci.dev/) instance (Kind + Tekton). One combined pipeline runs per push or PR:

- **Setup:** cluster via [upstream guide](https://github.com/konflux-ci/konflux-ci/blob/main/docs/bootstrapping.md), then run `hack/konflux/onboard-app.sh`
- **Active pipeline:** `.tekton/release-push.yaml` / `.tekton/release-pull-request.yaml`
- **Images:** `quay.io/rh-sdv-cloud/automotive-dev-operator` (+ `-bundle`, `-catalog`)

## Release Information

This project publishes versioned releases with:
- Multi-architecture container images (amd64, arm64)
- `caib` CLI binaries for Linux
- OLM bundles for OperatorHub distribution
